All results will be anonymised.","Welcome to Where we Move, this is a serious game involving houses, floodings and various measures you can take. Today we will play this game which will allow you to explore options on how you could protect your house and yourself. During the game, we will ask you to fill in some data sheets that will allow us to conduct some research on the game. It helps us analyse which choices were made during the game and your feelings regarding floodings. These forms will be anonymized and analysed later.

"14","1: Introduction","Every area on the map is a housing area. Natucity is surrounded by relatively large nature areas. Diketown is an urban area that is not necessarily surrounded by large natural or water areas but is protected by a dike and has more space for houses. The Unbesvillage is a nice area beside a river or a water channel. Every area has some municipal taxes to pay. Check your budget and expectations overview to know what you must pay every round to keep in mind when buying a house. Look at the map to start thinking about where you would prefer to live.","Before we start, let me introduce you to the area we will be playing in. As you can see on the table, we have three communities on the map. We have a dark green, nature-filled area that is protected from the river with a nature-based solution. This means that there is less space for houses. We have an urban area, a cityscape, which is protected from the river by an artificial dike. Lastly, we have a farmland area directly connected to the river. Each of these areas provides a certain amount of protection against river and rain flooding. You will represent a household living in one of these three areas. Which one that is, is up to you. In a little moment, you will be able to purchase your house. The goal of the game is to increase your satisfaction as much as possible. The house you choose influences your satisfaction. If you don't manage to buy your dream house right away, you will be allowed to move in the following rounds. We hope you can find and buy your dream house, keep your feet dry and have some money left to increase your satisfaction and pay off your house. I will now explain the rules of the game.","1","3"

If the house of a household is not protected and the area is flooded, the house will take damage and the household will lose satisfaction. Households can protect against two types of flooding: River and Rain flooding. Rain flooding happens when rain falls down in large quantities for a long period of time. This causes strain on the sewage system and results in damage. River flooding happens when a lot of excess water from neighbouring countries is brought back to our country and causes the riverbanks to be overtopped. A river overtopping has a large impact, larger than rain flooding. Streets can become rivers and gardens can become temporary pools. To see how much each private measure protects against the two types of flooding, households can look at the overview made by the government. (explain that prices are about 3x/5x more expensive for game balance, real prices on the facilitator sheet).\n\n","1","11"
